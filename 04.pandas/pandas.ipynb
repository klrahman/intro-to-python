    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to learn how we can work with datasets - combining tables, creating and re-arranging variables, selecting and sorting rows, and grouping and summarizing data. Mostly, we will be working with `pandas`, which is designed for data manipulation (again, read this as \"analyzing\" or \"working with\", not \"fabricating\"!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this exercise are the historic meteorological observations from the [Armagh Observatory](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/how-forecasts-are-made/observations/recording-observations-for-over-100-years) (1853-present), the Oxford Observatory (1853-present), the Southampton Observatory (1855-2000), and Stornoway Airport (1873-present), downloaded from the [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with the Armagh dataset we used previously, I have done the following to make the data slightly easier to work with:\n",
    "- Removed the header on lines 1-5\n",
    "- Replaced multiple spaces with a single space, and replaced single spaces with a comma (`,`)\n",
    "- Removed `---` to indicate no data, leaving these fields blank\n",
    "- Removed `*` indicating provisional/estimated values\n",
    "- Removed the 2023 data\n",
    "- Renamed the file (e.g., `oxforddata.txt` -> `oxforddata.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to use your own data (and there are loads of stations available!), please feel free. I have also included a script, `convert_metoffice.py` (in the `scripts/` folder), that will do these steps automatically. All you need to do is run the following from a terminal:\n",

    "```\n",
    "    convert_metoffice.py {station}data.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new file, `{station}data.csv`, that has converted + cleaned the data into a CSV format that can easily be read by `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## loading libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we load the libraries that we will use in the exercise at the beginning. We will be using three libraries:\n",
    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), for reading the data from a file;\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), for plotting the data;\n",
    "- [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), for working with filesystem paths;\n",

    "That's all for this exercise. To practice your skills, create a notebook file that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- loads the libraries that you need\n",
    "- loads the saved data file (**combined_stations.csv**)\n",
    "- helps you answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - what station has the highest recorded rainfall in the past 20 years, and on what date?\n",
    "    - what season has the lowest average rainfall? is it the same season for all four stations?\n",
    "    - what station has recorded the most months with `tmin` < 1°C? are all these observations from a single season?\n",
    "    - what is the median rainfall in months where `tmax` is greater than 20°C? make sure that your result is a number, not a **DataFrame**!\n",
    "    - what year saw the most total rainfall, using data from all four stations?\n",
    "    - what are the top 5 driest years, using only data from stations in Britain?\n",
    "    - what is the lowest annually-averaged monthly minimum temperature in the dataset, as measured by a single station?\n",
    "    - what is the sunniest month, on average, in Armagh?\n",
    "        - bonus: write a line that will rename the months from the number to a 3-letter abbreviation (**hint**: we saw an example of this using `.map()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bonus, try downloading at least one additional dataset from the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data), saving it to the **data** folder, and using the script provided (`convert_metoffice.py`) to convert the `.txt` file into a `.csv` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your new notebook file, remember to add this new data to your existing dataset (and re-save the file!), then repeat the analyis questions above."
